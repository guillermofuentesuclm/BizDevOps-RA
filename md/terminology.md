# BizDevOps Reference Architecture - Terminology

[PDF Version](/files/BizDevOps%20Reference%20Architecture%20-%20Terminology.pdf)

In BizDevOps-RA, having a common and shared terminology is essential to facilitate collaboration and ensure alignment among business, development, and operations teams. This necessity has been recognized in general software development contexts and becomes even more critical within the BizDevOps methodology due to the importance of effectively integrating and coordinating business roles with IT roles. The following terms are central to the BizDevOps methodology.

- **Agile Software Development:** A flexible approach to software development that
    emphasizes iterative progress and responsiveness to change.
- **Application Component:** An application component represents an encapsulation
    of application functionality aligned to implementation structure, which is modular
    and replaceable.
- **Application Data:** Structured information managed by applications, critical for
    supporting business processes and decision-making.
- **Application Function:** An application function represents automated behavior that
    can be performed by an application component.
- **Application Service:** An application service represents an explicitly defined
    exposed application behavior.
- **Architectural Building Blocks:** Core components within the BizDevOps-RA,
    covering essential requirements across business, application, and technology
    layers.
- **Backlog:** A prioritized list of requirements or tasks that guide development in agile
    approaches like DevOps or BizDevOps.
- **Behavioral Elements:** Components that represent dynamic elements like
    processes and functions within an architecture.
- **Business Need:** Fundamental business objectives and interests that could drive
    the development of IT solutions. These needs are expressed in terms of business
    goals and priorities and are subsequently translated into functional and non-
    functional requirements for software or application systems.
- **Business Object:** A business object represents a concept used within a particular
    business domain.
- **Business Process:** A business process represents a sequence of business
    behaviors that achieves a specific result, such as a defined set of products or
    business services.
- **Business Service:** Services offered by a business to fulfill internal or external client
    needs.


- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery):** Automated practices
    for integrating, testing, and deploying code.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automated release of code to production, enabling rapid
    feedback cycles.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Iterative process aimed at enhancing processes,
    services, and products.
- **Driver:** A factor that influences business or technical decisions within BizDevOps.
- **Enterprise Objective:** Organizational goal that drives BizDevOps processes and
    development efforts.
- **Functional Requirement:** Functional requirements are integral to defining the
    scope and behavior of the system. They are directly linked to user needs and
    business objectives, ensuring that the system provides the necessary
    functionalities to achieve desired outcomes. These requirements often form the
    basis for system design, development, and testing.
- **Integrated Team:** A team with cross-functional roles, facilitating collaboration
    across BizDevOps.
- **Internal Agreement:** Agreements within a BizDevOps team to ensure collaboration
    and alignment of efforts.
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** The simplest functional version of a product,
    delivered early for feedback.
- **Non-Functional Requirement:** Non-functional requirements are crucial for
    defining the system's quality and operational attributes. They ensure that the
    system performs efficiently under various conditions and meets user expectations
    regarding performance, security, and usability. These requirements are essential for
    user satisfaction and long-term system sustainability.
- **Product Owner:** A role responsible for defining and communicating product vision
    to meet business needs.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** A formal agreement on performance and
    availability expectations for services.
- **Stakeholder:** Individuals or groups with a vested interest in BizDevOps outcomes.
