      <documentation>Definition: The Building and Testing Process in BizDevOps is a crucial phase that focuses on the iterative development of the product and rigorous testing to ensure its quality. During this phase, the BizDevOps team employs continuous integration (CI) practices to develop, test, automatically integrate code, and validate product increments, enabling safe and satisfactory deployment into production. This incremental approach means that several iterations will take place, depending on the complexity of end-user needs. In the initial product increment rounds, the goal is often to turn the prototype into a working version of the software, known as the minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP contains the minimum necessary features to obtain user feedback and continue improving the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
Once the code has been integrated into a build using continuous deployment, the software is moved into the testing environment where a series of automated and manual tests, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT), are conducted. An important phenomenon in testing is the concept of Shift-left testing, which emphasizes early testing in the process, test automation, test data management, and the removal of test constraints to resolve defects early and accelerate time-to-market. This approach ensures that issues are identified and resolved as early as possible, guaranteeing the final product's quality and its alignment with user expectations and business objectives.​&#xD;

This process addresses the challenge of integrating business and IT domains, ensuring that the strategies, goals, and practices of both are aligned to maximize the value delivered to end users and maintain business agility.&#xD;
&#xD;
Alignment in BizDevOps focuses on two essential components: people and processes. Regarding people, it involves ensuring that all actors involved, both from business and IT, work towards the same goals. This is achieved by forming cross-functional and autonomous BizDevOps teams, where each member possesses skills both in their specialty and in other areas of the team, promoting closer collaboration and a better understanding between different roles. Process alignment involves integrating agile and DevOps practices with business strategies, facilitating continuous and effective communication between business stakeholders and development teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
A crucial aspect of the alignment process is the implementation of short and frequent feedback cycles, which allow the BizDevOps team to receive valuable insights from end users and make necessary adjustments to continuously improve the product. This iterative and data-driven approach ensures that software development not only meets technical requirements but also aligns with market expectations and needs. Additionally, the use of specific metrics and KPIs helps evaluate the performance of the team and the product, ensuring that decisions are made based on accurate and up-to-date information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, continuous alignment in BizDevOps not only focuses on delivering high-quality software but also on creating a collaborative and adaptable environment that can quickly respond to changes in business and market demands, always maintaining a user-centered vision.&#xD;

      <documentation>DevOps is sometimes viewed as being mostly focused on systems and applications deployment, and thus applicable mainly at the end of the life cycle. In practice, DevOps is a full life cycle endeavor which gives equal consideration to each stage. DevOps is a set of principles and practices which enable better communication and collaboration between relevant stakeholders for the purpose of specifying, developing, continuously improving, and operating software and systems products and services. It is not just a matter of technical practices affecting other life cycle processes.

Teams using DevOps typically start a systems or applications effort by creating a continuous delivery pipeline (set of tools and procedures) that takes the code from the source code management system and automates the complete application build, package, deployment (including transitions to other environments), operations, and sustainment workflow. Contributors often start with a simple program, write the pipeline, and then iteratively (and rapidly) develop their code. In development, multiple teams often integrate code continuously, automatically deliver the code to a test automation framework, and on to subsequent workflow participants. Transitions to other contexts in the workflow can require special enhancements to the workflow (e.g., simulation-based training or shadow operations) so that quality and velocity are not compromised during and after any transition.

DevOps is suitable for most life cycle process models, and particularly appropriate when teams adopt agile methodologies. DevOps can be just as valuable in an iterative waterfall approach.&#xD;

      <documentation>Business or mission first: DevOps focuses on business and organizational goals ahead of procedural and technical considerations. DevOps utilizes information-rich feedback loops to understand progress and threats to attaining business and mission goals. Taking a business or mission first view helps to balance the concerns of risk and the activities which provide the most value to the customer. Continuously finding a dynamic balance between opportunities and risks and applying risk assessment and treatment at the organizational level enables the realization of DevOps without thrashing and wasted resources. Realizing the full promise of DevOps requires maintaining a strategic balance between honoring today’s commitments while enabling the organization to survive risks and develop the capabilities to move forward.

Customer focus: DevOps takes a customer-centric view, prioritizing and designing work to deliver value to the customer, as well as identifying and managing risk. In short, if it makes sense for the customer and meets a customer need, then it is likely to be the right approach from a DevOps perspective. For example, for both customers and suppliers, privacy is a customer focus: not only protection of individuals’ data, but also protection of enterprise data. Privacy may include data categorization (e.g., health data, financial data) and classification- driven methods (e.g., confidential, restricted, internal use, public) as often required by regulatory and legal requirements.

Left-shift and continuous everything: The normal DevOps practice is information-driven, risk-based, continuous everything. DevOps continuous everything means using the same practices in development as in operations and sustainment. DevOps practices are founded on automation for continuous integration, delivery and deployment, and operations and sustainment. The approach to DevOps in this document is to build systems to be secure and verifiable from the very beginning. Risk management, quality assurance (QA), and testing are the practices that make accelerated velocity and continuous delivery possible.

Systems thinking: ystems thinking counters a myopic approach of utilizing specialists—such as networking professionals, database administrators, and systems administrators—who rarely communicate with either the development or operations teams and lack understanding of the system as a whole. In DevOps, taking a comprehensive view encourages technology professionals to fully understand the system from end to end. Systems thinking can enable resolution of complex and emergent problems that are not easily traceable to a single flaw. Systems thinking should apply to a consistent architecture for the enterprise tools used for DevOps as well as to the system under development.

The [Business Need] are composed of [Functional Requirement] and [Non-Functional Requirement], which are fulfilled by a [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]. This MVP is designed, built, and delivered to its users considering the [BizDevOps Software Development Process]. This software development process complies with the course of action [IT/Business Alignment while ensuring Agility], which represents how the organization has decided to build the software and is also supported by the [Business Capability]. This course of action is influenced by the drivers [IT/Business Alignment] and [Agile Software Development], which are assessed by [IT and Business are Aligned] and [Agility is Maintained], respectively.&#xD;

Considering the service orientation, the business service is executed by business processes [MVP Business Process], which can access [Business Information]. The [MVP Business Process] is served by [Application Service], which exposes the services offered by [Application Function]. The [Application] can access [Application Data] and provides everything necessary for the [Application Function] to offer its functions. The [Application] and [Application Function] uses [DevOps Infrastructure Service] to enable Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and others tasks, as well as to provide the necessary infrastructure to support the use of [Application]. This service orientation allows us to align the business ([MVP Business Process]) with information technologies [Application Service]. Additionally, it enables the alignment of information and data.&#xD;
&#xD;
The role [BizDevOps Team] includes roles such as [Product Owner] and [Agility Manager], who are associated with the drivers of [IT/Business Alignment] and [Agile Software Development], respectively. This ensures that the roles are aware of the tasks that will keep IT aligned with the business while developing software in an agile manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
The [Business Need] fulfill the [Enterprise Objective], allowing organizations to achieve their goals using the BizDevOps approach. Furthermore, the [Business Need] are influenced by architectural principles, which consider the [BizDevOps Principle], such as [Alignment], [Agility], among others.</documentation>

The [BizDevOps Process View] presents the processes that guide the development of a software product with BizDevOps. These processes ensure that the software development lifecycle is aligned with business objectives, promotes agility, and fosters continuous collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first stage, [Discovery], involves identifying and understanding the business needs, requirements, and constraints. This process sets the foundation for aligning IT services with business goals, ensuring that the subsequent development efforts are focused on delivering value. Following discovery, the [Definition] stage involves detailed specifications of the product, including functional and non-functional requirements. This ensures that the development team has a clear understanding of what needs to be built, aligning with the [Business Need] and organizational objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
Planning is crucial in the [Planification] stage, where realistic timelines, resources, and milestones for the project are set. This process involves creating a roadmap that outlines the steps required to deliver the product, ensuring that all team members are aligned and prepared for execution. During the [Building and Testing] phase, the actual development of the product takes place, followed by rigorous testing to ensure quality. Adopting agile practices, this stage emphasizes iterative development, continuous integration, and automated testing to identify and fix issues early.&#xD;
&#xD;
Once the product is built and tested, it moves into the [Delivery and Operation] phase. This process includes deployment, monitoring, and maintenance activities, ensuring that the product is delivered efficiently and operates smoothly, meeting the business requirements. An ongoing [Alignment] process ensures that the product and development efforts remain aligned with the changing business needs and market conditions. It involves regular reviews and adjustments to the project plan, ensuring continuous alignment of IT services with business goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
The [DevOps Processes] integrate development and operations activities to enable continuous delivery and deployment. These processes include configuration management, infrastructure as code, continuous integration, and continuous deployment, ensuring that the product is delivered quickly and reliably.&#xD;
&#xD;
Each of these processes is supported by the principles of BizDevOps, such as [Alignment], [Agility], and [Continuous Everything]. The processes are influenced by the drivers [IT/Business Alignment] and [Agile Software Development], ensuring that the development efforts are aligned with business objectives and agile practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
By following these processes, the [BizDevOps Team] can effectively fulfill the [Business Need], delivering a [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)] that meets business objectives and adds value. The integration of these processes ensures that the development lifecycle is streamlined, efficient, and aligned with the strategic goals of the organization, ultimately leading to the successful achievement of the [Enterprise Objective].</documentation>

This principle promotes a collaborative approach, breaking down silos and ensuring that all team members work towards common objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
[Business First]: This principle prioritizes organizational objectives over technical details. It ensures that all development and operational activities are driven by business goals, ensuring that the outcomes deliver maximum value to the organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
[Customer Focus]: Adopting a customer-centered approach is key to delivering maximum value. This principle emphasizes prioritizing tasks based on customer needs and managing risks effectively, ensuring that the end product meets or exceeds customer expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
[Shift-Left]: Anticipating tasks typically performed at the later stages of development, such as quality and security testing, and addressing them earlier in the lifecycle is crucial. This principle ensures that potential issues are identified and resolved early, reducing risks and improving overall quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
[Continuity in Everything]: Utilizing automated practices across business, development, and operations to maintain continuous process flow is essential. This principle supports continuous integration, continuous delivery, and other automated processes that enhance efficiency and reduce time-to-market.&#xD;
&#xD;
[Systems Thinking]: Promoting a comprehensive understanding of the system from start to finish helps in resolving complex issues that may arise. This principle encourages considering the broader impact of decisions and actions, ensuring that all components work together harmoniously.&#xD;
&#xD;
These principles collectively ensure that the BizDevOps framework is robust, flexible, and aligned with the strategic goals of the organization. By adhering to these principles, the organization can achieve better collaboration, faster delivery, and a stronger alignment of IT efforts with business objectives, ultimately leading to the successful fulfillment of the [Business Need] and achievement of the [Enterprise Objective].</documentation>

      <documentation>This viewpoint aims to improve communication and decision making within project teams, thereby effectively achieving designated objectives.

Stakeholders: The BizDevOps team, composed of the following roles: (i) Product Owner, (ii) Scrum Master (or ‘Agility Responsible’ if not following SCRUM), and Other DevOps roles.
Concerns: Managing a software project with BizDevOps while aligning IT/Business without sacrificing agility.
Porpurse:
	- Decide: Because it's in the interest of the BizDevOps team to make decisions regarding this perspective. This is considering that the perspective aims to facilitate alignment while maintaining agility and managing the project, and this could involve making decisions.
	- Inform: Because it's in the interest of the BizDevOps team that the software project management with BizDevOps can be clearly communicated among all team members.

Narrative: An essential aspect in DevOps is the high importance of automation through a software toolchain (toolchain), for example, for code repository and versioning, testing, continuous deployment, or infrastructure as code. With DevOps-AV, all this type of software is managed and represented in two complementary ways: i) standard software acquired from suppliers (e.g. Jenkins) is considered IT infrastructure (expressed as instances of the 'system software' element); and ii) adaptations, extensions or integrations in which we incorporate our own business logic are considered systems of our DevOps ecosystem (expressed as instances of the 'application component' element). This difference is justified because in organizational terms, an essential aspect in EA, it is important to know if something is easy to replace (infrastructure) or not (information systems) because inside it has things made or added by us.</documentation>
