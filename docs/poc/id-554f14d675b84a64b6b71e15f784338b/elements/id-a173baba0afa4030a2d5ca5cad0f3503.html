						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Business or mission first: DevOps focuses on business and organizational goals ahead of procedural and technical considerations. DevOps utilizes information-rich feedback loops to understand progress and threats to attaining business and mission goals. Taking a business or mission first view helps to balance the concerns of risk and the activities which provide the most value to the customer. Continuously finding a dynamic balance between opportunities and risks and applying risk assessment and treatment at the organizational level enables the realization of DevOps without thrashing and wasted resources. Realizing the full promise of DevOps requires maintaining a strategic balance between honoring today&#8217;s commitments while enabling the organization to survive risks and develop the capabilities to move forward.

Customer focus: DevOps takes a customer-centric view, prioritizing and designing work to deliver value to the customer, as well as identifying and managing risk. In short, if it makes sense for the customer and meets a customer need, then it is likely to be the right approach from a DevOps perspective. For example, for both customers and suppliers, privacy is a customer focus: not only protection of individuals&#8217; data, but also protection of enterprise data. Privacy may include data categorization (e.g., health data, financial data) and classification- driven methods (e.g., confidential, restricted, internal use, public) as often required by regulatory and legal requirements.

Left-shift and continuous everything: The normal DevOps practice is information-driven, risk-based, continuous everything. DevOps continuous everything means using the same practices in development as in operations and sustainment. DevOps practices are founded on automation for continuous integration, delivery and deployment, and operations and sustainment. The approach to DevOps in this document is to build systems to be secure and verifiable from the very beginning. Risk management, quality assurance (QA), and testing are the practices that make accelerated velocity and continuous delivery possible.

Systems thinking: ystems thinking counters a myopic approach of utilizing specialists&#8212;such as networking professionals, database administrators, and systems administrators&#8212;who rarely communicate with either the development or operations teams and lack understanding of the system as a whole. In DevOps, taking a comprehensive view encourages technology professionals to fully understand the system from end to end. Systems thinking can enable resolution of complex and emergent problems that are not easily traceable to a single flaw. Systems thinking should apply to a consistent architecture for the enterprise tools used for DevOps as well as to the system under development.
