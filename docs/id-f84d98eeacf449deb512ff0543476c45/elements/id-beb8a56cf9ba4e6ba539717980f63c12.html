The customer is the primary stakeholder representing the market's needs, expectations, and demands. Their involvement is crucial to ensure that the products developed are not only technically sound but also provide tangible and meaningful value.

The customer is involved in various stages of the software development lifecycle. During the discovery phase, customer feedback is vital for identifying and understanding user needs and market opportunities. This initial feedback helps form a clear product vision and define specific requirements that will guide development. In the definition phase, customers collaborate with BizDevOps teams to refine these requirements, ensuring that product specifications align with their expectations and needs.

Throughout development and operation, the customer continues to provide critical feedback, allowing for iterative adjustments and continuous product improvements. This ongoing interaction ensures that software development remains aligned with changing market demands and end-user expectations. The implementation of short and frequent feedback cycles facilitates the incorporation of the customer's perspective at every stage of the development process, promoting greater agility and responsiveness.

Additionally, customers use specific metrics and KPIs to evaluate the performance of the product and the team, ensuring that decisions are based on accurate and up-to-date information. This constant collaboration and user-centered focus ensure that the delivered products not only meet technical standards but also satisfy customer expectations and generate the desired value.</div>
