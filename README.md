# BizDevOps Reference Architecture
This study examines the transition from DevOps to BizDevOps through the use of a reference architecture, emphasizing the role of business capabilities in enhancing IT and business alignment. The objective is to develop a structured approach that facilitates this transition, ensuring greater coherence between IT operations and business strategies.

## Structure
- We have developed a document that details the reference architecture, which you can access [here](/BizDevOps-RA.pdf).
- We have developed a web version of the reference architecture, which you can visit from [here](https://guillermofuentesuclm.github.io/BizDevOps-RA/).
- We have made the BizDevOps reference architecture available in both [Archi tool format](/BizDevOps%20Reference%20Arhictecture.archimate) and [Open Exchange format](/BizDevOps%20Reference%20Arhictecture.xml).
